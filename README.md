# NBA_Injury_Predictions
This study explores the prediction of NBA injuries and their impact on player performance during the 2010-2018 seasons,
utilizing two main datasets: annual player statistics and an injury table. Injuries are classified into four types of injuries,
distinguishing between serious, mild, and minor. Employing a Na√Øve Bayes algorithm, injury prediction achieved a 65.2% accuracy rate
using a curated set of predictive variables. The analysis highlights ACL tears as the most detrimental injury to NBA players, 
significantly affecting their long-term career trajectories. The study suggests utilizing the predictive model for implementing 
preventive measures aimed at high-risk players, potentially reducing injury occurrences and safeguarding player health and performance.
